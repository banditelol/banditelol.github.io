After tinkering around with it I’m wondering if I can just scrape data from airtable without the use of API and just the feature of view sharing.</p><p>But, before I continue, <strong>Disclaimer :</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>this post is not sponsored by airtable or me promoting it. I’m just another user who is excited with certain product, and interested in make the most out of it.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>It is not a Tutorial, it is a journey of how I explore web scraping. So it may not be a good reference on how to do things.</strong></p></li></ol><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>First let me introduce you to Airtable. In Airtable you can make a *base *which analogues to <em>worksheet file</em> in Google Sheet. And fortunately Airtable offers lots of template for us to start with.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3796/1*xM6U652388rN1gjZCxwZiQ.png alt="A lot of template for your personal use to professional project management at work"><em>A lot of template for your personal use to professional project management at work</em></p><p>For now let us pick a simple book tracker just for example.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3802/1*8LwXykHIhe23_z8MIeCy2A.gif alt></p><p>After you open the template on your workspace, you will be greeted with the view inside your *base *which consists of two <em>tables</em> in this case (two tabs). i.e. table for Books and for Authors. In each table there are *records *(row) and for each records you can have one <em>primary field</em> (the leftmost column) and multiple <em>fields</em> (the rest of the column)</p><p>For example in our Books Table there are 5 records with primary field of book names, and each has 6 fields (excluding the primary field).Okay now We’ve got some basic covered, I believe it is better for you to try it out yourself since this post is not for introducing how to work with airtable, but how I want to scrape data from it and my progress on it.</p><h2 id=what-i-want>What I Want</h2><p>Actually what I want to do is pretty simple. We have multiple team, and each has a base with the same format and template. And every now and then I need to keep track of what’s happened in just one table of each base that every team has. And also I need to make a summary from them. And to be honest checking each of them is such a pain.</p><p>So I think of something, how about I just aggregate the data from each base? There must be an <a href=https://airtable.com/api>API</a> for it.</p><p>Well, guess what? yes there’s an API for it and there are library for that API whether in <a href=https://github.com/airtable/airtable.js/>Javascript </a>or for<a href=https://github.com/nicocanali/airtable-python> Python</a>. But if I want to use the API I need to be invited to the base and from the number of team that I monitor it may use up all my free plan quota (CMIIW, haven’t really try it, to be honest I just need an excuse to try web scraping). So since I am a cheapskate and I want to learn scraping anyway, I’ll just make it an exploration and a chance for me to learn.</p><p>Btw I get my motivation from a google sheet extension called <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/airtable-importer-by-rail/kngidnifbonbaembhpnjlpeefhmjpegb>airtable importer</a>, since it has been done before, I should be able to do it right? (well at least I hope so)</p><h2 id=lets-start>Let’s Start!</h2><h3 id=0-my-plan>0. My Plan</h3><p>Well in short I want to be able to copy the shared view link for a table and have a program to extract the data I want and make an aggregate of the data in a spreadsheet so that I won’t be bothered by the free plan limitation of airtable.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A0v4dy-02yBQghZCDUIOZA.png alt="This is what I want to achieve"><em>This is what I want to achieve</em></p><p>It should be easy, right?</p><h3 id=1-searching-the-data>1. Searching the data</h3><p>This is the view of what I want to scrape, you also can access it <a href=https://airtable.com/shrCTg33zQeyuv2Rs>here</a></p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3838/1*z5iM-nOmLUnQmp8gNeybUg.png alt="The shared view in chrome"><em>The shared view in chrome</em></p><p>Since it is on the web, and I could access it with browser, I could just fetch the data from the HTML right?</p><p>Turns out I am to naive for this, using chrome dev tools, I found out that:</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*1L5h3ILGyg3f4b_V0LV6EA.png alt="the complex structure of HTML"><em>the complex structure of HTML</em></p><p>The data exists! That means the data is there in the HTML. So I can scrape the data directly following the structure in the HTML. But After giving it more thoughts I assume that the data must be sent from the back-end and there’s a javascript there that select the div and populate it with table data. Maybe I could get the data with better format if I can get the data before it populate the table.</p><p>Here I’ve got two choices:</p><ol><li><p>Scrape the data from HTML</p></li><li><p>Try to get the data from HTTP request</p></li></ol><p>For now let’s try the second option first, since it sounds cooler</p><h3 id=2-finding-the-request>2. Finding the Request</h3><p>After looking closely on how the page load, I guess I could find out how the data is loaded into the table. So I used Network tab in Chrome DevTools and… There!</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3802/1*jNHQIOh8oknVM6Q0LXKQvg.gif alt="There’s time when the content suddenly get populated"><em>There’s time when the content suddenly get populated</em></p><p>If you look closely there’s this request that’s happened right before the content is loaded.</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3802/1*iW5kYej1SFYKyO8SmcRB_g.gif alt="THE DATA"><em>THE DATA</em></p><p>And there it is the data I need!</p><h3 id=3-pulling-the-request->3. Pulling the Request ?</h3><p>So how should I get it, I could just copy pasting it to postman and it will works right?</p><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3802/1*h_xQc26LZBOAM5wq9RTzow.gif alt></p><p>Turns out no. After reloading the page several times I found out that the RequestId part of the URL is changing each time. After a quick search on the matter I found out that RequestID is a truly unique code generated by the service (CMIIW). And for now I hit a wall here. Sooo I will step back and try the second method, by scraping the html.</p><p>Since the post got quite long in the progress, I will see you in part 2 on how I will try to scrape the data from HTML.</p></content><p><a href=https://banditelol.github.io/tags/learning/>#Learning</a>
