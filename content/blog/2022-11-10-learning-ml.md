Learning Machine Learning

As a machine learning engineer, staying up-to-date with my field is an absolute nightmare. On the one hand, you have the explosive rise of deep learning, diffusion, and transformer-based architectures which, even if not implemented, are important to keep an eye out for. On the other, there are hundreds of thousands of new MLOps solutions. In the middle is an ever-growing array of cloud-based services that mean you have to make informed engineering decisions about your stack. 

So, just to summarize, ALL you have to know to be an MLE is: 

+ a very in-depth understanding of engineering best practices
+ computer science theory
+ the fundamentals of machine learning 
+ YAML

When I first started making sense of this landscape, this felt insurmountable to me. I bought a lot of different books across a lot of different disciplines

But a good rule of thumb is that

Thanks to Julia for prompting this post and Sebastian for his list of resources! A few days ago, Julia asked on Twitter about how I learn machine learning and
