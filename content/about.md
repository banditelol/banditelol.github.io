Hi! I'm Vicki. I'm a [machine learning engineer at Tumblr.](https://applyingml.com/mentors/vicki-boykis/) working on recommender systems with deep expertise in YAML indentation.  I live in Philly with my family. In my free time, I love to write about Life. I also like to think about [what technology means](https://vicki.substack.com/) in the context of society, and write about that, as well. 

I also love tweeting terrible puns and doodling tech logos.
