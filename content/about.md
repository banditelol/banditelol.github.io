Hi, my name is Aditya Rachman Putra and I'm currently a Data Scientist in [Pitik](https://pitik.id). I have always been passionate about solving problem using programming and data, which led me to pursue a career in this field. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience and knowledge in Product Development and End to End Data Stack, and have had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients and projects.

In my free time, I enjoy Writing and Doodling in my notebooks and spending time with my family and friends. I am committed to making a positive impact in both my personal and professional life, and I look forward to connecting with you and exploring new possibilities together. 

I'm quite active in twitter, so if you're searching for someone to discuss about Data Science or deploying model to production, You can hit me up at [@banditelolRP](https://twitter.com/banditelolRP)
